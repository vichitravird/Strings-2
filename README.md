# Strings-2


## Problem1 
Implement strStr() (https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/)

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack, needle):
        for i in range(len(haystack) - len(needle) + 1):
            if haystack[i:i+len(needle)] == needle:
                return i
        return -1

## Problem2 

Find All Anagrams in a String (https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/)

Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.

Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings s and p will not be larger than 20,100.

The order of output does not matter.

Example 1:

Input:
s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"

Output:
[0, 6]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
Example 2:

Input:
s: "abab" p: "ab"

Output:
[0, 1, 2]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
    def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:
        hm, res, pL, sL = defaultdict(int), [], len(p), len(s)
        if pL > sL: return []

        # build hashmap
        for ch in p: hm[ch] += 1

        # initial full pass over the window
        for i in range(pL-1):
            if s[i] in hm: hm[s[i]] -= 1
            
        # slide the window with stride 1
        for i in range(-1, sL-pL+1):
            if i > -1 and s[i] in hm:
                hm[s[i]] += 1
            if i+pL < sL and s[i+pL] in hm: 
                hm[s[i+pL]] -= 1
                
            # check whether we encountered an anagram
            if all(v == 0 for v in hm.values()): 
                res.append(i+1)
                
        return res
